#  Navigating the file system
pwd -Print working directory
cd - change directory 
ls - Show all the files 
ls -a : hidden files, hidden files begin with .
ls -R /source/*

ls -l : long files, more information

# Creating files , copy, move ,rename and delete 

mkdir mydir : Creates a new directory 
touch myfile.txt : Create a text directory

mv orginalfile.txt ../testfile.txt

rm testfile.txt : deletes and removes testfile.txt in a directory -> this is gone 

more <filename>

___________Working with directories______________

cp -r Testdir CopyDir/
man cp and hit q to get out :Get the help about the command
mv TestDir RenameDir :Renames the TestDir to RenameDir
mv testcopydir/ copydir/ : Copies the testcopydir to copydir
rm -r testcopydir/ : This will delete the folder 
rm -r -f copydir/ : this will forcefully delete the directory 

_____________Working with Find ___________________

find . : finds all the files in the present working directory 
find Sub-dir/ : finds all the files present in the Sub-dir
find . -type d : finds all the directory in the present working directory 
find . -type f : find all the files in the present working directory
find . -type f -name "test1.txt" : find the file "test1.txt" in the present working dir
find . -type f -name "test*" : find the files that start with test, using wildcards 
find . -type f -name "*.py" : find all the files with an extension py in the dir
find . -type f -mmin -10 : find all the files modified in less than 10mins ago 
find . -type f -mmin +10 : find all the files modified more than 10mins ago
find . -type f -mmin +1 -mmin -5 : find all the files modified > 1 min ago and < 5mins ago
find . -type f -mtime +10 : find all the files modified more than 10 days  ago
atime - access-time
ctime - change -time

find . -size +5M : find all the files more than 5Megabites 
find . -perm 777 : find all the files and directories with permissions 777

________________Working with chown ____________________
demo.txt ls -l : this will list the permissions demo.txt has, as a root user you can chnages and assign ti user
chown owner-user file 
chown owner-user:owner-group file
chown owner-user:owner-group directory
chown options owner-user:owner-group file

________________Working with chmod _____________________

4 = read 
2 = write
1 = execute 
0 = no permission 

chmod u=rwx,g=rx,o=r myfile: user can read , write and execute, group can read and execute, others can read
chmod (4+2+1)(4+1)(4) myfile 
chmod 754 myfile
chmod 777 myfile : everyone can do everything 
chmod -r 777 mydir : changing the permissions on the directory


Giving Permission to specific user to access the folder 
You could use setfacl:

$setfacl -m u:username:rwx myfolder
This sets permissions for specific users, without changing the ownership of the directory.




_______________ Working with Processes __________________
top : list all the processes running, top is mostly used interactively 
ps : list all the processes, ps is designed for non-interactive use (scripts, extracting some information with shell pipelines etc.)
kill : kills any process 
kill 87988 : kills the process with PID = 87988
$ ps aux | grep synth

_______________ Working with Network __________________
ifconfig : The ifconfig command is used to get the information of active network-interfaces in a Unix-like operating system
ping www.google.come : pings a given url
wget <url> : downloads the content from a web -url 
wget --user=arvind.penumaka --ask-password <url-link>

___________ Miscillenous__________________
sudo - SuperUser Do
To create a tar.gz archive from a given folder you can use the following command
tar -zcvf tar-archive-name.tar.gz source-folder-name

This will compress the contents of source-folder-name to a tar.gz archive named tar-archive-name.tar.gz

To extract a tar.gz compressed archive you can use the following command
tar -zxvf tar-archive-name.tar.gz

to view the contents of tar file without extracting 

tar -tf filename.tar.gz

_________ Passing environment variables ______

docker compose -e PWD="./"
